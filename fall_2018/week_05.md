## Last Week's Accomplishments
Last week I looked into shuttle prediction in between updates and worked on my
part in our group's presentation.

## This Week's Plan
This week I will begin implementing the shuttle prediction that I have looked
into. I will likely start out by simply assuming that the shuttle will maintain
the same velocity in between updates, and slowly increase or decrease the
velocity to the updated value when an update is received.

## Anything Blocking?
Time; I had a lot of homework this week as well as midterms to study for.
