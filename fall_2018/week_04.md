## Last Week's Accomplishments
Last week I wrote some backend code to save the last update received for each
shuttle and calculuate the display rotation for shuttle markers.

## This Week's Plan
This week I will likely work on predicting shuttle location in between updates
received in order to make shuttle movement on the map smooth and uninterrupted.

## Anything Blocking?
The only thing blocking progress this week was time. I had homework for every
class and a test to study for.
