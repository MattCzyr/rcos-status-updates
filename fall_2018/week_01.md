## Last Week's Accomplishments
Decided to get started with RCOS and joined the Shuttle Tracker project to work
on the iOS app.

## This Week's Plan
This week, I plan to to:
- Learn the basics of Swift and XCode
- Figure out how to use GET requests to fetch the vehicle data from
  shuttles.rpi.edu/vehicles

## Anything Blocking?
My limited knowledge of Swift, but I'll get by.
