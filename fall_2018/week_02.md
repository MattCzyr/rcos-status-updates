## Last Week's Accomplishments
Last week, I created a fetchVehicles() function to retrieve the vehicle
information from shuttles.rpi.edu/vehicles and a Vehicle struct to store the
fetched data.

## This Week's Plan
This week, I'll figure out how to put the fetched JSON data into the Vehicle
struct.

## Anything Blocking?
Limited time because of tests!
