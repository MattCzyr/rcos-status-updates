## Last Week's Accomplishments
Last week, I created more robust shuttle estimation tests. They work by keeping
track of the last estimation calculated for each vehicle and comparing these to
the new update for each vehicle when they are received. The differences, or the
"estimation errors," are then logged to text files and the average estimation
error is calculated for each vehicle at the end of its lifecycle.
