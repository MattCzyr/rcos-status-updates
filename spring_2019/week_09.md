## Last Week's Accomplishments
Last week, I:
- Opened a detailed PR with all the work I've done on shuttle prediction,
  waiting for it to be reviewed.
- Recolored the proposed app icon to match the in-app color scheme and
  recreated it as 1024x1024 in Photoshop.
- Opened a PR with the new icon, which has been reviewed and merged.
- Refactored all the code to use consistent conventions across the project,
  especially on the frontend as it hadn't been done in a while.
- Added Swift markup comments to all functions that hadn't been documented
  already.
- Opened a PR with the refactoring.

## This Week's Plan
Hopefully this week the shuttle prediction PR will be reviewed and merged so
that I can work on integrating those changes with all the other frontend
work that's been done lately. Other than that, I plan on doing some testing on
the shuttle prediction to see just how inaccurate it is currently and how we
could make it better. I may also work a bit on scheduled notifications so they
can actually be used.

## Anything Blocking?
