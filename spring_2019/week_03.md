## Last Week's Accomplishments
This week, I...
- Added switches to the settings panel to toggle nearby notifications and
  scheduled notifications on and off.
- Added a "Scheduled Trips" section to the settings panel that will, in the
  future, display the trips that the user has scheduled to be notified for
  and allow them to schedule more.
- Added references to these switches to the ViewController and functions to
  control their actions. The switches are not functional yet.
- Reviewed the issue that I was assigned to, in which some updates contained
  unknown key/value pairs. I was not able to recreate this issue; it may have
  been a temporary issue with the Shuttle Tracker backend.

## This Week's Plan
This week, I plan to:
- Put the finishing touches on the frontend, specifically the settings panel.
- Make the switches functional, as they currently are not.
- Open a pull request with all the notifications and settings work I've done.

## Anything Blocking?
The current blocker I'm running into is making the switches functional; I need to
find out how to link the switches in the storyboard to the references in the
ViewController.
