## Last Week's Accomplishments
This week, I:
- Added a "Nearby Notifications" section to the settings panel to toggle on and
  off notifications for specific shuttle routes
- Fixed the margins for labels and switches in the settings panel
- Spent a while researching how to make the switches functional but was unable
  to figure out how to link the references in the view controller to outlets.
- Documented what frontend work still needs to be done with the settings
  panel.
- Opened a huge pull request with all the notification work I've done in the
  last month, including extensive documentation.

## This Week's Plan
This week, I plan to work on fixing conflicts in the pull request I opened.
I will also work on improving the shuttle prediction algorithm, since shuttles
now move on the map.

## Anything Blocking?
A blocker I encountered this week was figuring out how to make the switches in
the settings panel functional. I couldn't (and still can't) seem to link the
references in the view controller to outlets, but I'll keep looking at
tutorials.
