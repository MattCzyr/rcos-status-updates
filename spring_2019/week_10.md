## Last Week's Accomplishments
Last week, I:
- Contributed to the presentation for Shuttle Tracker iOS and Notifications.
- Made scheduled notifications trigger automatically for each user-defined
  trip and added functions in the view controller to manipulate nearby and scheduled
  notifications settings.
- Started running tests on how accurate shuttle position predictions are.

## This Week's Plan
This week, I plan to finish  working more on scheduled and nearby notifications.
If schedule data is available by then, I can fully automate scheduled
notifications. I will also make a write-up on the accuracy of shuttle position
predictions after I gather enough data with the tests I've written.

## Anything Blocking?
N/A
